## TypeScrip Tutorial

## Terminology
- Strong Typed Languages: demand the specification fo type!.
- Loosely Typed Languages: do not require type specification
- JavaScript: Loosely Type Language, aka "weakly Typed"

**Relates to:**
- Static Typing
- Dynamic Typing
- But it is NOT the same
- A language that is strongly typed can be either statically OR
dynamically typed!
- TypeScript is a statically typed language. This means types are checked at compile time.
- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means types are checked at run time.

**Benefits include:**
- Self-documenting
- catch errors in dev!
- Great for teams
